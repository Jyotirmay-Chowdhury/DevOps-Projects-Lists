DevOps All Projects Lists with Descriptions.

# 1) Java Application using Gradle
Gradle is a well-known build automation tool that works across a variety of platforms and languages. This project includes establishing a Java application and breaking it down into subprojects in order to modularize it.

After completing this project, you will know how to initialize a project as a Java application, run the build and build its test report. You will learn the way to execute a Java application and build it in an archive.

# 2) WebServer using Docker
Docker is a popular container technology for hosting services and applications that virtualizes operating systems and builds lightweight containers. You will create a default base image for this project that other developers can use in their production environments. This project offers the framework for web app images in Python, Ruby, and Meteor.

On successful completion of this project, you will be able to reduce the size of the Dockerfile and shorten the time it takes to write a Dockerfile. Also, you will learn to correctly set up the base system and reduce the amount of time it takes to run the docker build and the download time.

# 3) CI/CD Pipeline using Azure
You’ll use Azure DevOps Project to set up continuous delivery (CD) and continuous integration (CI) pipelines in this project. You may get started by using the provided code. The purpose is to quickly deploy an app to a variety of Azure services, including App Service, Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).

In this project, you’ll use Azure’s DevOps Starter feature to establish an ASP.NET sample code, explore the CI/CD pipelines configured by DevOps Starter, commit code changes and run CI/CD, and configure Azure Application Insights monitoring.

# 4) Jenkins Remoting Project
Jenkins Remoting is a library and archive for creating a communication layer. TCP protocols, data streaming, procedure calls, and other features are all included.

In this project, you will have to improve Jenkins Remoting, a communication layer implementation library. Jenkins Remoting can be made compatible with a bus technology like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ. You’ll need knowledge of networking fundamentals, Java, and message queues to execute the task.

# 5) CD Pipeline using AWS
You will develop a continuous delivery pipeline for a small web application in this project. To store your source code, you’ll first use a version control system. 

Then you’ll learn how to set up a continuous delivery pipeline that will deploy your web application automatically anytime your source code is updated. This project uses GitHub, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline.

# 6) Deploying a Containerized Web Application
This project demonstrates how to package a web application as a Docker container image and run it on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. The web application is then deployed as a load-balanced collection of replicas that can scale to meet the demands of your users.

This project will help you in learning of how to package a sample web application into a Docker image, upload the Docker image to Artifact Registry, create a GKE cluster and deploy it to the cluster, manage autoscaling for deployment, expose the app to the internet and deploying a new version of it.

# 7) Building Version Control System
You can use a Version Control System to keep track of your code, inspect multiple versions of it, switch between them, maintain different versions of it, and share it with other programmers.

You will start with the basics and save code in our version control system. You will have to take a long way to set up a repository in order to do so. From there, you will figure out how to navigate through history. Then you will figure out how to handle branching, which is deceptively difficult in and of itself. You’ll be ready for Git once you’ve finished branching.

# 8) Deploying Application Using Kubernetes
In this project, you are going to use a simple web service that parses user messages and adds your message to a Redis Server. It is similar to a voicemail where the users can leave messages. 

This project needs to run the application on Kubernetes, hence dockerizing is the primary step in this project. Hence, you will learn how to enable the application to run in docker containers.

# 9) Structuring a Terraform Project
In order to ensure its maintainability and extensibility in day-to-day operations, Terraform projects must be properly structured according to their use cases and perceived complexity.

This project will teach you how to organize Terraform projects based on their general purpose and complexity. Then, using the more popular Terraform features such as variables, localities, data sources, and provisioners, you’ll design a project with a simple structure. In the end, your project will use DigitalOcean to deploy an Ubuntu 20.04 server (Droplet), install an Apache web server, and point your domain to it.

# 10) Building and Executing Selenium Project
Test automation requires the creation and execution of Selenium projects. It facilitates the execution of tests, the analysis of reports, and the reporting of bugs. 

Needless to say, this aids in the faster delivery of high-quality products to clients, making them happier. You will be able to demonstrate how to develop a Selenium project employing both a “Java Project” and a “Maven Project” after completing this project.
